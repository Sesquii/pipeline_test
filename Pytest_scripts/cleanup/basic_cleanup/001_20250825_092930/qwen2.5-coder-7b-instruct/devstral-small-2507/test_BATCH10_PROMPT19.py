This test suite includes comprehensive tests for both the `correct_word` and `process_text` methods of the `SelfCorrectingSpellingBot` class. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization to handle multiple scenarios efficiently. The tests cover positive cases, negative cases, edge cases, and ensure that the bot behaves as expected under various conditions.
