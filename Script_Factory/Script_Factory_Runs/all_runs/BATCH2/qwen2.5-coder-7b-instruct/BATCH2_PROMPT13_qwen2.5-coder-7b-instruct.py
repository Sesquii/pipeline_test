This script defines a function `expand_acronym` that takes an acronym and a depth as input. It recursively expands the acronym according to a predefined dictionary of known acronyms until the specified depth is reached. The main entry point demonstrates how to use this function with an example acronym "NASA" and a recursion depth of 3.
