This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for all public functions and classes in the `MemoryLossStoryteller` class. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and separates the original code from the test code as required.
