This Python program, `BATCH2_PROMPT25_qwen.py`, takes a Python script as input and randomly inserts comments into it. The comments are either entirely unrelated to the code or are absurdly detailed for very simple lines of code. The program reads the input file line by line, checks if each line already contains a comment, and inserts a new comment if it doesn't. The new comment is selected from a predefined list of unrelated and absurdly detailed comments. The modified script is then written back to the same file.
