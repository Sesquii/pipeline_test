This Python program defines a recursive function `draw_shape` that draws an abstract shape using ASCII characters. The function takes parameters for the starting coordinates, size, and character used to draw the shape. It recursively draws smaller shapes at each corner of the current shape, creating a fractal-like pattern. The example usage in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates how to call the function to draw a shape with an initial size of 10 and the asterisk character '*'.
