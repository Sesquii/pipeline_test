This test suite covers all public functions and classes from the original script. It includes both positive and negative test cases, uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code as per the requirements.
