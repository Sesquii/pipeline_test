### üìå Explanation

This script performs image annotation using simulated object detection by applying a predefined set of bounding boxes and labels. It ensures reproducibility with `random.seed(42)` and distinguishes between correct and incorrect labels using distinct colors (green for correct, red for incorrect).

#### üîß Key Features:

- **Input Handling**: Uses command-line arguments to specify the image path.
- **Object Detection**: Hardcoded list of detections with true labels.
- **Random Selection**:
  - 60% of detections are kept as is.
  - Remaining 40% are randomly assigned incorrect labels from a predefined pool.
- **Annotation**:
  - Draws bounding boxes in distinct colors based on correctness.
  - Places text labels at the top of each box for visibility.
- **Output**: Saves the annotated image as `output.png` in the current directory.

### üß™ Assumptions and Notes

- The input image is expected to be in BGR format, which is standard with OpenCV.
- The script assumes that the detection list is hardcoded but can be easily modified.
- Colors are chosen for clarity: green (correct) vs. red (incorrect).
- Text positioning ensures it remains readable and visible on the image.

### üìù Summary

This script provides a straightforward, reproducible solution for simulating object detection with annotated images using standard libraries. It's designed to be flexible and easy to extend by modifying the detection list or label pool.
