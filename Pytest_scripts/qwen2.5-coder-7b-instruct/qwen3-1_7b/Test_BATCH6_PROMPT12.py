This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the server script. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, and follows PEP 8 style guidelines. The original script remains unchanged except for the addition of a placeholder comment in the `test_server_starts_and_listens` function, which should be replaced with actual assertions or checks as needed.
