This code snippet defines a Python script that calculates the "distance" between two points using an incorrect formula that violates standard Euclidean geometry. The function `calculate_distance` takes two tuples representing points in a 2D plane and returns the calculated distance. The main block demonstrates how to use this function with an example.
