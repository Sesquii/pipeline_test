This Python program implements a "Self-Correcting Spelling Bot" that reads a text file, purposefully misspells every tenth word, and corrects the spelling of its next occurrence in the file. The `self_correcting_spelling_bot` function handles the main logic, while helper functions `misspell_word` and `correct_spelling` assist with specific tasks. The program uses Python's standard library and is designed to be run from the command line by specifying input and output file names.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `misspell_word`, `correct_spelling`, and `self_correcting_spelling_bot` functions. It uses pytest fixtures to create temporary input and output files, ensuring that the tests do not interfere with each other. The test cases cover both positive and negative scenarios, including edge cases like missing next words and empty input.
