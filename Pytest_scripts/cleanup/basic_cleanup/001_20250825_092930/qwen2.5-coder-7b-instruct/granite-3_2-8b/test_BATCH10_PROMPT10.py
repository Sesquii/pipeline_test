This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `get_ip_location`, `generate_weather`, and `main` functions. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and separates the original code from the test code clearly.
