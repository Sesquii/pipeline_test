    Calculate the distance between two points in a non-Euclidean space.
    
    This function uses an incorrect formula that violates standard Euclidean geometry.
    For demonstration purposes, it calculates the Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean distance.
    
    Parameters:
    - point1: A tuple (x1, y1) representing the first point.
    - point2: A tuple (x2, y2) representing the second point.
    
    Returns:
    - The "distance" between the two points using the incorrect formula.

Please note that this code intentionally uses an incorrect formula for calculating the "distance" between two points, which violates standard Euclidean geometry. The Manhattan distance is used as a fictional alternative to demonstrate the concept.
