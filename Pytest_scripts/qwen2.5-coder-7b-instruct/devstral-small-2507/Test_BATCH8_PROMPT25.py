This test suite includes a basic test case to ensure that the `loop` function can be called without causing an infinite recursion. It also uses parametrization to test multiple scenarios, although in this specific case, the function does not take any parameters. The tests capture the output using a context manager and check if the expected string is present in the captured output.
