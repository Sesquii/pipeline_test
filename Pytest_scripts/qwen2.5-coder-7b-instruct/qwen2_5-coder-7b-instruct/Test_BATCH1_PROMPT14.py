This solution includes comprehensive test cases for the `delayed_chatbot` function, including positive and negative scenarios. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and separates the original code from the test code clearly.
