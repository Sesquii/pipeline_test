# Optimized Scripts Folder

## Purpose
Contains scripts that have been processed by optimization steps (Tasks 4A, 4B, 4C, and optionally 4D).
These are refined versions of the raw scripts, possibly cleaned for performance, clarity, or reduced bugs.

## Contents
- Optimized versions of each raw script.
- Clear metadata about:
  - Which optimization pathway was used (A/B/C/D)
  - Which model performed the optimization
  - Any performance metrics post-optimization

## To-Do
- After initial script generation, run the optimization pipeline and save outputs here.
- Compare optimized scripts against raw scripts for functional correctness and entropy change.
- Track whether different optimization strategies yield consistently better (or worse) results.
