# Entropy Logs Folder

## Purpose
Collects the measurements and metadata from entropy analysis runs.  
Helps quantify "chaos" in generated scripts and compare across models, prompts, and bit calibrations.

## Contents
- JSON/CSV files of entropy metrics (capacity, allure, orientation, baseline).
- Comparative tables between models and configurations.
- Timestamped logs of processing runs.

## To-Do
- After generating and analyzing scripts, store entropy scores here.
- Maintain consistent metric naming so values are comparable across runs.
- Use these logs to refine prompt selection and model choice for future testing.
