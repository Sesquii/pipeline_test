This test suite includes two functions to test the `broken_csv.py` script. The first function, `test_read_broken_csv`, checks that the CSV file is read correctly and that each row has the expected number of columns. The second function, `test_read_broken_csv_with_errors`, tests that an error is raised when attempting to read a broken CSV file with intentional errors.
