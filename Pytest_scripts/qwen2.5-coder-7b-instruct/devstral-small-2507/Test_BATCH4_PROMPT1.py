This solution includes a test suite for the original script. It tests both `fibonacci` and `time_based_fibonacci` functions with various inputs, including positive numbers, zero, and negative numbers. The test suite uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, and it follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
