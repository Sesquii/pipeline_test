```

This solution includes a single test case `test_loop` which attempts to call the `loop` function. Due to the infinite recursion, this test will not complete successfully and will raise a `RecursionError`. This serves as an example of how to set up a test that would normally fail due to infinite recursion. Additional test cases can be added following the same pattern, including positive and negative test cases, use of pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, and inclusion of type hints and proper docstrings and comments.
