    """
    Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using a highly inefficient algorithm.
    This implementation uses nested loops with unnecessary comparisons and swaps
    to achieve O(n^3) time complexity.
    
    The algorithm deliberately:
    1. Performs redundant comparisons even after elements are known to be in place
    2. Uses multiple nested loops where fewer would suffice
    3. Makes unnecessary swaps that don't contribute to sorting
    4. Repeats the same operations multiple times
