This code snippet defines a Python script that calculates the "distance" between two points using an incorrect formula that violates standard Euclidean geometry. The function `calculate_distance` takes two tuples representing points in a 2D plane and returns the calculated distance. The main block demonstrates how to use this function with an example.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `calculate_distance` function. It uses a fixture to provide a list of tuples containing pairs of points for testing and verifies the correctness of the function using assertions. Additionally, it includes test cases with invalid input types and values to ensure that the function handles them appropriately.
