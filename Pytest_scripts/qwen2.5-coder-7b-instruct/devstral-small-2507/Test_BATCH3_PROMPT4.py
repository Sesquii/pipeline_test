This test suite includes comprehensive tests for both the `analyze_sentiment` function and the `rename_file_based_on_sentiment` function. It uses pytest fixtures to create temporary sample files, ensuring that the tests are isolated and do not affect the file system outside of the test environment. The tests cover positive, negative, and neutral sentiment cases, as well as edge cases such as non-existent files and exceptions during file operations.
