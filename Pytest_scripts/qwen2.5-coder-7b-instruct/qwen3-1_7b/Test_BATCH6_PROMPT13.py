This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for all public functions and classes in the original script. It uses pytest fixtures to create a test client for the Flask application, and it parametrizes some of the test cases to ensure that both positive and negative scenarios are covered. The tests include type hints, proper docstrings, and comments, following PEP 8 style guidelines.
