This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for both the `generate_story` and `memory_loss_storyteller` functions. It uses pytest fixtures to mock the `time.sleep` function, ensuring that the actual sleep is not executed during the tests. The tests cover positive scenarios and ensure that the output meets the expected criteria.
