This Python script defines a function `expand_acronym` that takes an acronym and recursively expands it into a new, meaningless acronym until the specified depth is reached. The synonyms for each letter are defined in a dictionary, and the script uses these to build the expanded acronym. The base case for recursion is when the depth reaches 0, at which point the function returns the current state of the acronym. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block allows the user to input an acronym and the desired depth, and then prints the resulting expanded acronym.
