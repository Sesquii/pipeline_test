This Python script defines a simple sentiment analysis function that counts positive words in a given text. It then renames a specified text file by appending "_happy" to its name if the content is more positive (i.e., contains more positive words). The script includes a clear entry point for testing with an example file.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for both public functions in the script. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code.
