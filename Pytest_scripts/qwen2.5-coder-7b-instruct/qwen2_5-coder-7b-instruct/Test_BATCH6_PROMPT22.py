# Entry point of the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Welcome to the Insult Generator CLI. Type anything to get an insult.")
    
    # Infinite loop to keep the CLI running
    while True:
        input()  # Wait for user input
        random_insult = random.choice(insults)  # Select a random insult from the list
        print(random_insult)  # Print the selected insult
```

This Python program implements a simple conversational command-line interface that generates a random insult from a predefined list each time the user types anything. The program uses the `input()` function to wait for user input and the `random.choice()` function to select a random insult from the list.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `get_random_insult` function and the main program logic. It uses pytest fixtures to mock user input and output, and parametrization where appropriate. The test cases include both positive and negative scenarios, and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
