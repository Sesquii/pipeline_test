This code defines the `inefficient_sort` function, which uses three nested loops to intentionally create a cubic time complexity. The comparisons and swaps inside the loops are unnecessary and designed to be as computationally wasteful as possible. The example at the bottom demonstrates how to call this function with a sample list and print the sorted result.
