Prep LLM Roster

Select ~10 open-source models of varying sizes & quantizations (e.g., 7B, 13B, 20B, 120B; INT2, INT4, FP16, FP32).

Install & test each to ensure they can generate code on your hardware.

Pick 1 Script Idea (from the 25 ideas below).

Generate 1 “Reference Implementation” using a high-tier model (e.g., GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4).

This gives a “source intent” for the others to try and match.

Run Same prompts and codes (see entropy processing simulation modes)


Save All Outputs as one script unit (10 scripts).

Repeat for all 25 ideas → yields 1000+ total scripts.
