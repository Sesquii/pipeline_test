This test suite includes a single test case `test_loop` that attempts to call the `loop` function. Since the `loop` function is designed to create an infinite recursion, this test will not complete successfully and will raise a `RecursionError`. The use of `pytest.raises(RecursionError)` ensures that the test passes if the expected exception is raised.
