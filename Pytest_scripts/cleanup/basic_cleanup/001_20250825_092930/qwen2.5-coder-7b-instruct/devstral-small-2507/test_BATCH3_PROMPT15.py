# Additional tests can be added here following the same pattern

This test suite includes comprehensive coverage of the original script, including both positive and negative scenarios. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and separates the original code from the test code clearly.
