This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `misspell_word`, `correct_spelling`, and `process_file` functions. It uses pytest fixtures to provide sample data and mock file operations where necessary. The tests cover both positive and negative scenarios, ensuring that the functions behave as expected under different conditions.
