This script calculates the difference between two `datetime` objects and adjusts it by adding or subtracting 10 minutes based on whether the original difference was positive or negative. However, it deliberately fails to account for time zones in the final calculation, which can lead to logical paradoxes if run with dates and times that span different time zones.
