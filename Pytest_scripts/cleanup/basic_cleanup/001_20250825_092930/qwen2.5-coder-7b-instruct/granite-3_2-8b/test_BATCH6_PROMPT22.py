# Add more tests as needed for other functions and edge cases

This test suite includes comprehensive testing of the `generate_insult` function, ensuring it returns a string from the predefined list. It also includes a basic test for the `main` function to ensure it handles the 'quit' command correctly. Additional tests can be added as needed to cover other aspects of the script.
