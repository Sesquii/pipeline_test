Conversational Command Line Interface (CCLI) - A Bizarre Extravaganza of Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome, intrepid explorer! You've stumbled upon the Conversational Command Line Interface, a tool so
unfathomably complex that it defies description. Yet, here we are, plunging into its depths together.

1. **The Inception of Execution (EOX)**
   - EOX is an enigmatic process that, when initiated, triggers a cascade of computational events. It's like
     the Big Bang but for your command line interface. To invoke this cosmic phenomenon, utter:

       ```
       python BATCH6_PROMPT25_{model_name}.py --execute-operation
       ```

   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: A swirling vortex of computational power that may or may not solve the mysteries of the universe.

2. **The Quantum Query (QQ)**
   - The QQ is a feature that allows you to query the cosmos itself, harnessing the power of quantum entanglement
     to deliver answers from the very fabric of reality. To perform this mind-boggling feat, simply call:

       ```
       python BATCH6_PROMPT25_{model_name}.py --query-the-cosmos "What is the meaning of life?"
       ```

   - Parameters: A string query (e.g., "What is the meaning of life?")
   - Returns: An answer possibly more profound than you could've ever imagined, or a cryptic riddle.

3. **The Time Traveling Task (T3)**
   - T3 enables you to manipulate temporal anomalies for your command-line tasks. Use it wisely:

       ```
       python BATCH6_PROMPT25_{model_name}.py --time-travel "Set date to yesterday"
       ```

   - Parameters: A string instruction (e.g., "Set date to yesterday")
   - Returns: Your system's clock might just jump back in time, or it could all be a clever simulation.

4. **The Dimensional Dump (DD)**
   - The DD function allows you to dump files into higher dimensions, potentially freeing up local storage space. Invoke with caution:

       ```
       python BATCH6_PROMPT25_{model_name}.py --dimensional-dump /path/to/file
       ```

   - Parameters: A file path string (e.g., "/path/to/file")
   - Returns: The file's multidimensional imprint, or a wormhole to an alternate reality.

Please note that using these features may result in unpredictable side effects, including but not limited to: spontaneous caffeine synthesis, the appearance of leprechauns, or the discovery of new elements in your periodic table.

We accept no responsibility for any temporal paradoxes, spatial distortions, or existential crises that may arise from using this tool. Happy exploring!
