This Python script, `BATCH3_PROMPT23_{{model_name}}.py`, takes a directory path as input and recursively finds all files within that directory. It then prints each filename repeated a specified number of times (default is 3), creating an "echo-based" effect. The script uses the `os.walk` function to traverse the directory tree.
