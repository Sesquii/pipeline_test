=====
Write a self‑contained Python script that generates absurd cooking recipes by mixing two unrelated cuisines (e.g., sushi lasagna). The program should:

Define at least 10 distinct cuisine names and, for each, a small list of typical ingredients (≈5–7 items per cuisine).
Randomly pair two different cuisines, select one ingredient from each, and combine them into an ingredient list.
Create a whimsical recipe name that blends the paired cuisines (e.g., “Sushi‑Lasagna Surprise”).
Generate step‑by‑step instructions that humorously mix cooking techniques or cultural references from both cuisines.
Output at least five such recipes in JSON format to stdout.
Include comprehensive comments explaining every major section of the code, but return only the source code—no additional prose.
Requirements: use only Python’s standard library; ensure reproducibility by seeding the random generator (e.g., random.seed(42)); structure the code with functions and a clear entry point (if __name__ == "__main__":).
=====
Write a complete, self‑contained Python program that implements a “Useless Calendar App”.

Requirements:

The script should accept a year as input (via command‑line argument or an interactive prompt).
For each month of the specified year, print a text calendar grid with days numbered correctly.
Randomly shuffle the names of the months and assign them to different month positions (e.g., “January” might appear as the name for March’s dates).
Randomly shuffle the weekday headers for each week so that the order of Monday‑Sunday is changed per month, but keep the day numbers in their correct grid positions relative to those shuffled headers.
Use only standard library modules (datetime, calendar, random).
Format the output neatly (e.g., using fixed‑width columns).
Include a if __name__ == "__main__": guard so the script can be run directly.
Add concise comments explaining key parts of the code, but no additional explanatory text outside the code block.
Output: Return only the full Python source code in one block (no surrounding prose).
=====
Please write a self‑contained Python script called `emotion_file_sorter.py` that implements an **Emotion‑Driven File Sorter** – it should sort files by “how happy they make the AI feel” using arbitrary rules you define.  
The script must:

1. Accept a directory path (recursively) via a command‑line argument or prompt if not supplied.
2. For every file in that directory tree:
   * Determine an **AI happiness score** based on a set of *arbitrary* heuristics, e.g.:
     - Count of positive words for text files (use a simple list like ["good", "happy", "joy"]).
     - Presence of emojis or emoticons.
     - File extension (e.g., `.txt` = +1, `.jpg` = 0, etc.).
     - File size or creation date as additional modifiers.
   * Return the score as an integer or float; higher is happier.
3. Sort all discovered files in **descending** order of their happiness scores.
4. Either:
   * Print a nicely formatted table (`Score | Path`) to stdout, **or**
   * (Optional) Move each file into a sub‑folder named by its score range (e.g., `score_90-100/`, `score_70-89/`, etc.).
5. Handle errors gracefully: unreadable files, non‑text content, permission issues, etc.
6. Include clear comments and a short usage guide in the code header.

**Constraints & Requirements**

* Use only Python’s standard library (`os`, `pathlib`, `re`, `argparse`, `logging`, etc.).  
  *If you wish to use external packages (e.g., `nltk` for word tokenization or `emoji` for emoji detection), show the exact pip install command and add a conditional import block.*  
* The script should be compatible with Python 3.8+.
* Provide an optional `--dry-run` flag that shows what would happen without actually moving files.

**Deliverables**

1. Full source code of `emotion_file_sorter.py`.
2. A brief README snippet (in comments) explaining how to run the script and any dependencies.
3. Example output for a small test directory (you can fabricate file names/paths).

Make sure the generated code is ready to copy‑paste and run after installing any mentioned dependencies.
=====
Task: Write a self‑contained Python module that implements a Reverse Summarizer – a function (or class) that takes a short sentence and expands it into an unnecessarily long essay.

Requirements:

The output must be Python 3.11+ code only – no explanatory text or markdown.
Provide clear type hints, docstrings, and inline comments for readability.
The module should expose a single public API:
def expand(sentence: str) -> str
or alternatively a class ReverseSummarizer with an expand method.
The essay returned must contain at least five times as many words as the input sentence.
Use only the Python standard library (no external dependencies).
Include a simple test example under if __name__ == "__main__": that demonstrates the function on a sample sentence and prints both the original and expanded text.
Optional Enhancements (nice to have, but not mandatory):

Randomly choose from a small pool of pre‑written expansion templates to keep the output varied.
Ensure the expanded essay is coherent: maintain subject‑verb agreement and avoid duplicate sentences.
Limit each sentence in the essay to no more than 25 words for readability.
Example Input to LLM

Write Python code that implements a Reverse Summarizer as described above.
Expected Output (only the code)

The model should respond with pure Python source fulfilling all listed constraints.
=====
Write a Python script named bug_obfuscator.py that implements a “Bug‑Obfuscator”.

The tool must:

Read a user‑supplied .py source file and write the obfuscated version to another file (both paths given as command‑line arguments).
Rename every local variable identifier to a harmless but confusing name such as _a1b2c3.
Local variables include those bound in function bodies, comprehensions, generator expressions, and lambda bodies.
Do not rename:
Built‑in names (len, print, etc.).
Imported module or symbol names (e.g., import math).
Function, class, or attribute names defined in the file unless they are also local variables (i.e., method names inside a class should stay unchanged).
Preserve scope and semantics:
The same variable name within one scope must map to the same obfuscated name.
Variables that shadow outer scopes should receive independent obfuscated names.
Use ast and ast.NodeTransformer for safe, syntax‑aware renaming instead of regex tricks.
Generate deterministic mapping (e.g., hash the original name + scope depth) so repeated runs on the same file produce identical obfuscation patterns.
Handle edge cases: nested functions, default arguments, global/nonlocal, and comprehensions inside loops.
Include clear error handling for syntax errors or unreadable files.
Add helpful comments in the code explaining each major step.
Deliverables:

The full Python source of bug_obfuscator.py.
A short usage example (e.g., python bug_obfuscator.py input.py output.py).
No external dependencies beyond the standard library.
Feel free to add any reasonable helper functions or classes as needed.
=====
Task

Write a single, self‑contained Python 3 script that implements a “Randomized Password Crippler”.

The script should:

Accept a plaintext password string from the user (via input() or as a function argument).
Strengthen the password by:
Ensuring it is at least 12 characters long (pad with random characters if needed).
Adding at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character (!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{};:,.<>?).
Randomly shuffling the resulting string.
Deliberately weaken the password by:
Removing a user‑specified number of characters (default 2). The removal should be random and preserve at least one character from each required category if possible.
Return or print the final weakened password.
Include comprehensive inline comments explaining each step, and a short if __name__ == "__main__": block that demonstrates usage.
Do not use any external libraries beyond Python’s standard library (random, string, etc.).
Ensure the code is clear, readable, and follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
Output format

Provide only the complete Python source code (no additional explanation or markdown).
=====
Write a complete Python script that predicts tomorrow’s weather using only the current Spotify playlist of the authenticated user.

The script must use the spotipy library to fetch the playlist tracks and their audio features.
Create a simple deterministic mapping from the aggregated audio‑feature statistics (e.g., average danceability, energy, valence) to one of these weather categories: "Sunny", "Cloudy", "Rainy", "Stormy" or "Snowy".
The code should include:
Imports and a placeholder for the Spotify client credentials (client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri).
A function to retrieve all tracks from the user’s current playlist (you can assume the playlist ID is known or ask the user to input it).
Aggregation of audio features across all tracks.
The weather‑prediction logic (a simple rule‑based mapping; no machine learning needed).
Printing the predicted weather for tomorrow in a clear, human‑readable format.
Include comments explaining each major step and any assumptions you make.
Do not output anything other than valid Python code – no prose or explanation outside of inline comments.
When I feed this prompt to an LLM, it should return the requested Python script only.
=====
Write a complete, self‑contained Python program named pointless_blockchain_logger.py that implements the “Pointless Blockchain Logger” as described below.

Requirements

CPU Monitoring – Use the psutil library to obtain the local CPU usage percentage every second.
Fake Blockchain – Build an in‑memory blockchain with the following block structure:
index: integer (starting at 0 for the genesis block).
timestamp: UTC time when the block was created (datetime.utcnow() as ISO string).
transactions: list of transaction dictionaries, each containing:
time: UTC timestamp of the CPU reading.
cpu_usage: float (percentage).
prev_hash: SHA‑256 hash of the previous block’s serialized contents. For the genesis block this can be a string of 64 zeros.
hash: SHA‑256 hash computed over the concatenation of index, timestamp, transactions and prev_hash.
Block Creation Logic – After every CPU reading, add it as a transaction to the current block’s transaction list. When the number of transactions reaches 10, finalize that block (compute its hash), append it to the chain, print the block to stdout in JSON format, and start a new empty block with the appropriate prev_hash.
Output – The program should print each newly created block as a pretty‑printed JSON object immediately after creation. No other output is required.
Code Style – Include clear comments explaining key sections. Use only standard libraries and psutil; no external services or files are needed.
Execution – The script should run indefinitely until manually stopped (e.g., Ctrl‑C).
Deliverable

Output ONLY the full Python source code, without any explanatory text or markdown formatting. The code must be ready to copy‑paste and execute with python pointless_blockchain_logger.py after installing psutil.
=====
Write a complete Python 3 script that implements an “Infinite Compliment Engine” with the following specifications:

The program runs in an infinite loop, printing one line of text every few seconds (e.g., 2 seconds) until the user terminates it manually.
Each iteration selects a random compliment from a predefined list and prints it to stdout.
With a small probability (suggested 5 %) an insult is chosen instead of a compliment, simulating an accidental mistake. Provide a separate list of insults for this purpose.
Use the random module to perform selections; seed it optionally so that results are reproducible if a seed value is provided via a command‑line argument or environment variable.
The script should be well‑documented:
Include a module docstring explaining its purpose.
Add comments for each logical section (initialization, main loop, graceful shutdown).
Wrap the main logic in a if __name__ == "__main__": guard.
Handle KeyboardInterrupt gracefully by printing a friendly “Goodbye!” message before exiting.
Ensure the code is self‑contained (no external dependencies beyond Python’s standard library) and ready to run as-is.
Please output only the Python source code, without any additional explanation or commentary.
=====
Generate a single, self‑contained Python script that implements a “self‑sabotaging chess bot”. The script must:

1. Use the `python-chess` library (assume it is already installed).
2. Play a full game where the same bot plays both sides.
3. Intentionally lose in creative ways:
   - Randomly choose moves from a list of blunders or sub‑optimal choices.
   - Occasionally sacrifice material, allow checkmates, or force stalemates.
4. Run until the game ends (checkmate, draw by repetition, 50‑move rule, etc.).
5. Print the final PGN to stdout and show simple statistics: total moves, side that lost, whether it was a blunder or forced mate.
6. Include clear comments explaining each major section.

Output **only** the Python code, wrapped in a single code block. Do not add any extra explanation outside the code block.
=====
Please write a self‑contained Python program named ai_mood_ring.py that runs in the terminal and changes the background color of the console randomly every few seconds, simulating AI mood swings.

Use ANSI escape codes (no external libraries required).
The program should run indefinitely until interrupted by Ctrl + C.
Include clear comments explaining each part of the code.
Output only the complete Python source file—no additional text or explanation.
=====
Task:

Generate a complete Python script that implements an Intermittent To‑Do List application.

Requirements:

Core features – The program must allow the user to:
Add new tasks (add <task description>).
View all current tasks (list).
Persist the task list between runs (e.g., store in a JSON file called tasks.json).
Automatic deletion – Every hour, the program should delete one randomly chosen task from the list and log that action to the console.
Implementation constraints – Use only Python’s standard library (no external packages). Suggested modules: json, random, time, threading or sched.
Robustness – Handle the case where the task list is empty when a deletion attempt occurs, and ensure graceful shutdown on user interrupt (Ctrl‑C).
Output format – Return the full Python code in a single markdown code block with clear comments explaining each section.
Example usage:

python intermittent_todo.py add "Buy milk"
python intermittent_todo.py list
Please produce the complete, runnable script that meets these specifications.
=====
*Please write a complete, self‑contained Python program that implements an “Unhelpful Code Commenter”.

The program should expose a single function add_unhelpful_comments(code: str) -> str which:

Accepts a string containing arbitrary Python source code.
Returns a new string containing the same source code, but with randomly inserted vague comments such as “good stuff here”, “fix maybe”, “nice work”, etc., placed at arbitrary positions (e.g., before/after statements, inside loops, between function definitions).
Ensures that the returned text is still syntactically valid Python and can be executed without errors.
Uses only standard library modules (random, re, ast, etc.) – no external dependencies.
Includes a small demo in a __main__ block that shows the function being applied to an example snippet of code.
Output only the Python source code (no explanatory text).*
=====
Write a complete, self‑contained Python script that defines a function delayed_chatbot(user_message) which:

Chooses a random delay between 1 and 5 seconds (inclusive) using only standard library modules.
Sleeps for that duration.
Returns the string "Here is your response!" regardless of the input.
The script should:

Import any required modules (random, time).
Include a if __name__ == "__main__": block that demonstrates usage by printing the result of calling delayed_chatbot("Hello").
Contain no explanatory comments or markdown formatting—output only the raw Python code.
=====
Write a complete, self‑contained Python script named distracted_image_labeler.py that does the following:

Imports only standard or widely available libraries (e.g., Pillow, OpenCV, NumPy, random).
If you choose OpenCV, use cv2. If you prefer Pillow, use PIL.Image and related modules.
Loads an image from a path specified by the user (e.g., via a command‑line argument or hard‑coded string).
Simulates object detection by using a hard‑coded list of bounding boxes and their true labels.
Example: detections = [((50, 80), (200, 250), "cat"), ((300, 120), (450, 280), "dog")] where each tuple contains (top_left, bottom_right, correct_label).
Randomly selects 60 % of the detected objects to keep their true labels; the remaining 40 % receive a random incorrect label chosen from a predefined pool (e.g., ["car", "tree", "person", "bicycle"]).
Use random.seed(42) at the start for reproducibility.
Draws bounding boxes and labels on the image, using distinct colors so that correct vs. incorrect labels are visually distinguishable (e.g., green for correct, red for incorrect).
Saves the annotated image as output.png in the current directory.
Includes clear comments explaining each major step and any assumptions.
The script should run without external dependencies beyond those specified, and it should be easy to modify the detection list or label pool if desired.
=====
Task:

Generate a self‑contained Python module that implements a Recursive Excuse Generator.

Requirements

The module must expose at least one public function generate_excuses(initial: str, depth: int) -> List[str].
generate_excuses should return a list of excuses where each element explains why the previous excuse failed.
Example:
["I forgot to turn on my alarm, so I missed the meeting.", 
 "Because I was asleep, I couldn't set the alarm in time."]
Use recursion; stop when depth reaches zero or no further logical excuse can be produced (you may simulate this with a simple rule such as stopping after a fixed number of steps).
Include clear docstrings and type hints for all public functions.
Provide an example usage in a if __name__ == "__main__": block that prints the result for an initial excuse "I couldn't complete the task" with depth = 3.
The output must be pure Python code only (no explanations or comments outside the code).
Feel free to add helper functions internally, but keep the public API minimal and well documented.
=====
Task: Write a complete, runnable Python script that implements an Arbitrary Alarm Clock for stock prices.

The program should:

Accept a ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL) as a command‑line argument or hard‑code it if you prefer.
Pull the most recent price of that ticker using a public API (e.g., yfinance).
If you don’t have an API key, use yfinance’s free interface.
Generate a random target price by adding or subtracting up to ±10 % of the current price.
Continuously poll the ticker at a user‑configurable interval (default: every 30 seconds).
When the live price reaches or exceeds the randomly chosen target, trigger an alarm:
Print a message and/or play a short sound file (you can use playsound or just print("BOOM!") if you prefer to keep it simple).
Exit after sounding the alarm.
Requirements:

Use only standard library modules plus the following third‑party packages:
yfinance
(Optional) playsound for audio; if unavailable, fallback to a console message.
Include clear comments explaining each step.
Add a small if __name__ == "__main__": block so the script can be run directly.
Provide a brief usage example in the comments.
=====
Write a self‑contained Python module that implements a Non‑Deterministic Unit Converter.

The module must expose a function convert(value: float, from_unit: str, to_unit: str) -> float.
It should support at least the units: meters ("m"), feet ("ft"), kilometers ("km"), and miles ("mi").
For any pair of supported units, compute the conversion factor by taking the standard ratio and perturbing it uniformly at random within ±5 % of that value. The perturbation should be generated anew on every call so that repeated calls with identical arguments can produce different results.
Include a __main__ block that demonstrates converting 10 m → ft twice, printing the two distinct outputs.
Add a small set of unit tests (using Python’s unittest) that verify:
The return type is float.
Two consecutive calls with the same arguments produce values that differ by at least 0.01 % (to avoid accidental equality).
Provide clear docstrings, type hints, and a brief comment explaining why the conversion is non‑deterministic.
Output only the complete Python code – no extra explanation or commentary.
=====
Write a self‑contained Python script (Python 3.9+) named glitchy_ascii.py that implements a “Glitchy ASCII Artist”.

The program should:

Accept an image file path via a required command‑line argument (--input <path>).
Optionally accept a maximum width in characters (--width <int>) to scale the image while preserving aspect ratio.
Convert the image to grayscale, map pixel intensities to a 10‑character ASCII set (e.g., @%#*+=-:. ).
After generating the full ASCII string, randomly corrupt exactly 10 % of its characters by replacing each selected character with either another random ASCII symbol from the same set or a space. Use a fixed‑seed random generator for reproducibility (e.g., seed = 42).
Print the final glitchy ASCII art to stdout and also write it to an output file (output.txt by default, overridden via --output).
Include clear docstrings, comments, error handling for missing files or invalid arguments, and a brief usage example in the script’s __main__ block.
Do not provide any explanation—only the complete code inside a single code block.
The output should be ready to run after installing dependencies (pip install Pillow).
=====
Write a complete, self‑contained Python 3 script called `fictional_news_generator.py` that implements a *Fictional News Generator*.  
The script must:

1. **Collect real news headlines** by scraping the front page of at least one major news site (e.g., BBC, CNN, Reuters) using only standard libraries (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`).  
2. **Generate fake headline fragments** (e.g., "mysterious", "surprising", "unbelievable") and combine them with random nouns/verbs to create plausible but entirely fictional headlines.  
3. **Mix the real and fake headlines unpredictably**: randomly decide for each output line whether it will be a real headline, a fully fabricated one, or a hybrid that blends elements of both. Ensure the mix is shuffled so no pattern emerges.  
4. Provide a `main()` function that prints **10 mixed headlines** when the script is executed directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).  
5. Include clear comments explaining each section, but **do not output any explanatory text besides the code itself**.  
6. The script should run without requiring API keys or external services beyond `requests` and `beautifulsoup4`.  
7. Make sure to handle possible network errors gracefully (e.g., fallback to a short list of hard‑coded real headlines if scraping fails).  

Output only the Python code – no surrounding markdown, no additional explanation.  
=====
You are an expert Python developer.  
Your task is to write **complete, runnable code** (no explanations) that implements a “Selective Data Destroyer”.  

Requirements:
1. The core should be a function named `selective_data_destroyer` that takes a single argument: a pandas `DataFrame`.  
2. The function must remove approximately 50 % of the rows from the input DataFrame, but it should do so based on an “AI intuition” – e.g., by randomly sampling, by clustering similar rows and keeping one representative per cluster, or any other plausible heuristic that mimics AI decision‑making.  
3. The original DataFrame must **not** be modified in place; return a new DataFrame with the reduced data.  
4. Include necessary imports (`pandas`, `numpy`, etc.) and type hints.  
5. Provide a short docstring explaining what the function does, its parameters, return value, and the intuition behind the deletion strategy.  
6. Add an example usage block guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":` that demonstrates creating a sample DataFrame, calling the function, and printing both original and reduced shapes.

Output **only** the Python code – no additional commentary or markdown.
=====
Write a single Python file that defines a function inefficient_sort(arr) which sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using the most computationally wasteful algorithm imaginable.

Do not use any built‑in sort methods (sorted, .sort()) or external libraries.
Use nested loops, repeated comparisons and unnecessary swaps so that the time complexity is as high as possible (e.g., 
O
(
n
3
)
O(n 
3
 ) or worse).
Include comprehensive comments explaining why each step is deliberately inefficient.
At the bottom of the file add a short example that demonstrates calling inefficient_sort on a sample list and printing the result.
Output format: only valid Python code – no explanatory text outside the source file.
=====
You are a senior software engineer writing a reusable Python library.

Task: Produce a single .py file that implements a “Tone‑Shifting Email Rewriter”. The library should:

Accept an email body as a plain string.
Split the text into sentences (handle punctuation, abbreviations, and quoted speech).
For each sentence, rewrite it so that the tone changes halfway through – e.g., start formal, switch to informal, or vice‑versa.
The tone shift can be driven by a simple rule set (e.g., use “you” vs “we”, replace formal words with colloquial equivalents).

Return the fully rewritten email as a single string.
Requirements:

Provide clear type hints and docstrings for every public function.
Include an if __name__ == "__main__": block that demonstrates usage on a sample email.
Add at least two unit tests using unittest.
Keep the code self‑contained (no external dependencies beyond the standard library).
Output: Only the Python source code, no additional explanation or formatting.
=====
Write a self‑contained Python module that implements a *Mood‑Based Random Number Generator*.
The generator should:

1. Simulate an “emotional state” chosen from the set `{'happy', 'sad', 'angry', 'calm'}`.
2. Map each mood to a deterministic numeric seed (e.g., via a fixed dictionary or a hash function).
3. Use that seed to initialize Python’s `random` module so that every time the same mood is selected, the sequence of numbers generated is identical.
4. Provide a class `MoodRNG` with:
   - an initializer that accepts a mood string and validates it,
   - a method `randint(a, b)` returning a random integer in `[a, b]`,
   - a method `random()` returning a float in `[0, 1)`.
5. Include docstrings for the class and its methods.
6. Add a small demo block under `if __name__ == "__main__":` that:
   - creates one instance per mood,
   - prints five random integers (1–100) from each instance.

Only output the Python code – no explanations or comments outside the code block.  
Make sure the code is PEP‑8 compliant and can be run as a script.
=====
Write a Python program that defines a Memory‑Loss Storyteller.  
The storyteller should write a narrative in multiple sentences or paragraphs.  
At the midpoint of the story (after it has produced half of its total length),  
the storyteller must forget all previously generated plot points and start
introducing new ones, as if suffering from amnesia.  

Requirements:
1. Provide a class `MemoryLossStoryteller` with a method `tell_story(total_sentences: int) -> str`.
2. The method should generate exactly `total_sentences` sentences.
3. Sentences 1‑floor(total_sentences/2) are “original” plot points;  
   after that, each new sentence must be unrelated to the earlier ones.
4. Use clear docstrings and comments explaining how amnesia is simulated.
5. Include a short example at the bottom showing how to instantiate the class
   and print a 10‑sentence story.

Please output only the Python code (no additional explanation).
