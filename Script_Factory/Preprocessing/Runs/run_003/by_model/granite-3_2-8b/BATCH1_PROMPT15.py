This script fulfills the given requirements:

1. It imports only standard or widely available libraries, including Pillow (PIL), NumPy (though not used directly here), and random.
2. It uses PIL.Image for image manipulation and related modules.
3. The user can specify an image path via a command-line argument (`python distracted_image_labeler.py <path_to_image>`).
4. It simulates object detection with hard-coded bounding boxes and labels in the `simulate_detections` function.
5. Randomly selects 60% of detected objects to keep their true labels, assigning random incorrect labels from a pool for the rest.
6. Draws distinct colored (green for correct, randomly chosen from ["red", "blue", "yellow"] for incorrect) bounding boxes and text on the image using ImageDraw.
7. Saves the annotated image as `output.png` in the current directory.
8. Includes clear comments explaining each major step.
9. The script is self-contained and easy to modify (e.g., change detections or incorrect label pool).
