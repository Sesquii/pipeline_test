### Explanation:

1. **Core Features**:
   - **Add Task**: The user can input a task description and add it to the list.
   - **List Tasks**: Displays all current tasks in a numbered format.
   - **Persistence**: Tasks are saved to `tasks.json` when added or modified, and loaded on startup.

2. **Automatic Deletion**:
   - A background thread runs every hour to delete one random task from the list.
   - The deletion is logged to the console with a message indicating which task was removed.

3. **Robustness**:
   - If the task list is empty, the deletion operation will print "No tasks to delete."
   - Graceful shutdown on `Ctrl+C` (KeyboardInterrupt) by setting a global flag and waiting for the scheduler thread to finish.

4. **Implementation Constraints**:
   - Uses Python's standard library modules: `json`, `random`, `time`, and `threading`.
   - The script runs as a single process with a background deletion scheduler.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The full code is enclosed in a markdown code block with clear comments explaining each section, making it easy to read and understand.
