This Python program uses the Flask library to create a simple web server with one endpoint `/status`. The endpoint has a 50% chance of returning a 200 OK response with a random quote and a 50% chance of returning a 403 Forbidden response with a cryptic error message.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for all public functions and classes in the original script. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code.
