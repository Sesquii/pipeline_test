This Python script defines a function `poetic_data_visualizer` that takes a list of numerical data points and visualizes it as a short, abstract poem. The length of each line in the poem is determined by the magnitude of the corresponding data point, with longer lines representing larger numbers and shorter lines representing smaller numbers. The main block demonstrates how to use this function with a sample data set.
