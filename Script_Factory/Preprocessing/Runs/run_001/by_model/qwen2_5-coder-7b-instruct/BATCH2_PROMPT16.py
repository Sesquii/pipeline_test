This Python script defines a function `poetic_data_visualizer` that takes a list of integers and visualizes it as a poem where each line consists of asterisks (`*`) whose number corresponds to the value in the data series. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates how to use this function with an example data series.
