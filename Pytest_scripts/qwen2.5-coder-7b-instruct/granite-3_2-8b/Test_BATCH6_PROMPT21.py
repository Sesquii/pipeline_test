This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for both the `cli` group and the `enthusiastic_greeting` command. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code.
