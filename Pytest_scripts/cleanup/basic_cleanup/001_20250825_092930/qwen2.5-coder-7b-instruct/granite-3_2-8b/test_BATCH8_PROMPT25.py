In this solution:
- The original script is provided as is.
- A test case is added using `pytest` to check the behavior of the `loop` function. Since the loop is infinite, it's expected that the test will hang unless interrupted manually. This demonstrates how to write a test that should not pass in practice.
- Type hints are not applicable here as the script does not use any type annotations.
- The test case includes a docstring explaining its purpose and behavior.
- PEP 8 style guidelines are followed, including proper naming conventions for functions and comments.
