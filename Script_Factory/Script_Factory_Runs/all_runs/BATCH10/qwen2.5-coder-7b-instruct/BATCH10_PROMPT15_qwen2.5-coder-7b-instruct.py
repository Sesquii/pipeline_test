This Python program sets up a logging configuration to log errors to a file named `predictive_error_handler.log`. It defines a context manager `predictive_error_handler` that catches any exceptions raised within its block and logs them without re-raising. The entry point of the program demonstrates how to use this context manager with an example code that intentionally raises a division by zero error.
