This test suite includes comprehensive testing for the `exaggerated_word_counter` function. It covers various scenarios such as valid input, non-existent column name, empty CSV file, and missing column in CSV data. The use of `StringIO` allows us to simulate a file-like object from string data, which is useful for testing without creating actual files on disk.
