This test suite includes comprehensive tests for the `compute_distance` function, covering positive and negative inputs, zero distance, non-integer inputs, large inputs, and mixed type inputs. It uses fixtures to provide test data and parametrization where appropriate. The tests are written using pytest and include proper docstrings and comments.
