# Test suite ends here.

This test suite includes comprehensive tests for the `enthusiastic_welcome` function, covering both positive and negative scenarios. It uses pytest fixtures (`capsys`) to capture output and `patch` from `unittest.mock` to simulate user inputs. The test cases are well-documented and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
