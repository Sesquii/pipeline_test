This script uses the `python-chess` library to simulate a chess game where the same bot plays both sides. The bot intentionally makes blunders or sub-optimal moves, sacrifices material, allows checkmates, or forces stalemates to lose the game in creative ways. It runs until the game ends and prints the final PGN along with simple statistics about the game.
