This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `exaggerated_word_counter` function. It covers positive scenarios, such as counting values in a CSV file with valid data and an invalid column name, as well as negative scenarios, such as handling an empty CSV file. The tests use pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, and include type hints to test functions.
