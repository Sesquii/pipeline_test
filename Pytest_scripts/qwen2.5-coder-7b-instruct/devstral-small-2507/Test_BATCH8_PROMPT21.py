This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `generate_calendar` function. It covers both positive and negative scenarios, including leap years, non-leap years, invalid months, and negative years. The tests use pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, and include type hints to ensure clarity and correctness in the test functions.
