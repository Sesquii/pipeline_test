This Python script defines a `ChattyCLI` class that inherits from `cmd.Cmd`, creating a simple command-line interface. Each command method (e.g., `do_list`, `do_create`) includes an overly verbose confirmation message to meet the requirement. The `cmdloop()` method is called in the entry point to start the interactive loop of the CLI.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for all public methods of the `ChattyCLI` class. It uses pytest fixtures to capture and reset the standard input and output streams, ensuring that each test case runs in isolation. The tests cover both positive scenarios (valid commands) and negative scenarios (invalid commands or edge cases).
