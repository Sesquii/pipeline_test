Certainly! Below is a complete, runnable Python script that implements an Arbitrary Alarm Clock for stock prices. This script uses `yfinance` to fetch the latest price of a given ticker and continuously polls the price at a user-configurable interval. When the live price reaches or exceeds the randomly chosen target, it triggers an alarm.

```python
import sys
import time
import random
from playsound import playsound

def get_latest_price(ticker):
    """Fetch the latest price of the given ticker using yfinance."""
    import yfinance as yf
    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
    hist = stock.history(period="1d")
    return hist['Close'][0]

def play_alarm_sound():
    """Play an alarm sound or print a message if playsound is not available."""
    try:
        playsound('alarm.mp3')  # Replace 'alarm.mp3' with your actual sound file
    except Exception as e:
        print("BOOM!")

def main(ticker, interval=30):
    """
    Implement an Arbitrary Alarm Clock for stock prices.
    
    Args:
    ticker (str): The ticker symbol of the stock to monitor.
    interval (int): The polling interval in seconds (default: 30).
    """
    print(f"Monitoring {ticker}... Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
    
    try:
        current_price = get_latest_price(ticker)
        target_price = current_price * (1 + random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1))
        
        while True:
            time.sleep(interval)
            live_price = get_latest_price(ticker)
            
            if live_price >= target_price:
                print(f"Alarm! Target price {target_price} reached or exceeded with live price {live_price}")
                play_alarm_sound()
                break
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nStopped by user.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        ticker = sys.argv[1]
        interval = int(sys.argv[2]) if len(sys.argv) > 2 else None
        main(ticker, interval)
    else:
        print("Usage: python script.py <ticker> [interval]")
        print("Example: python script.py AAPL 60")
```

### Usage Example

To run the script, save it as `stock_alarm_clock.py`. You can execute it from the command line with the following syntax:

```sh
python stock_alarm_clock.py AAPL [interval]
```

- Replace `AAPL` with the desired ticker symbol.
- Optionally, provide an interval in seconds (default is 30 seconds).

### Notes

1. **Ticker Symbol**: The script accepts a ticker symbol as a command-line argument or hard-codes it if you prefer. In the example above, it's hardcoded to `AAPL`.
2. **API**: The script uses `yfinance` for fetching stock prices. If you don't have an API key, use `yfinance`'s free interface.
3. **Alarm Sound**: The script attempts to play an alarm sound using `playsound`. If `playsound` is not available or fails, it falls back to printing "BOOM!".

### Dependencies

Make sure you have the required packages installed:

```sh
pip install yfinance playsound
```

This script should work as expected, providing a simple yet effective Arbitrary Alarm Clock for monitoring stock prices.
