This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `get_calendar` function. It covers typical scenarios, edge cases, and error handling. The use of fixtures and parametrization is not necessary in this case since we are testing a single function with a small set of inputs. Type hints and proper docstrings have been added to enhance readability and maintainability.
