This Python script defines a function `poetic_data_visualizer` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a string representing a poem. The length of each line in the poem corresponds to the value of the data point, with longer lines for higher values. Words are randomly selected from a predefined list to create an abstract representation. The script includes a simple test case within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
