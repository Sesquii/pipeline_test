This Python script defines a function `generate_poem` that takes a list of strings and generates a short poem where each line's length is based on the number of words in the corresponding string. The main entry point demonstrates how to use this function with a sample list of strings.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `generate_poem` function, covering positive and negative scenarios. It uses redirection of stdout to capture the output and compares it against expected results. The test suite also includes a test case to check handling of non-string input, which should raise a `TypeError`.
