This program defines a `Surrealist` class with the `dream_logic` method that creates nonsensical yet consistent output based on input arguments. The example demonstrates surreal behavior where strings are transformed into lists of functions returning reversed versions, integers and floats are similarly transformed into lists of functions performing mathematical operations, and any other type results in a list of null functions.
