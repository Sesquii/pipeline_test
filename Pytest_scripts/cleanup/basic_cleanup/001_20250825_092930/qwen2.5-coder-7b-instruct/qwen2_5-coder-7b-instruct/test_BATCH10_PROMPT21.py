This Python program uses the `hashlib` library to securely hash the current timestamp, which changes every second. The first 10 characters of the hash are used as the password. The program runs in an infinite loop, generating and printing a new password every minute.

This test suite includes comprehensive tests for both the `generate_password` and `main` functions. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, and follows PEP 8 style guidelines. The test cases cover positive and negative scenarios, including testing password length, uniqueness, consistency, output, and loop behavior.
