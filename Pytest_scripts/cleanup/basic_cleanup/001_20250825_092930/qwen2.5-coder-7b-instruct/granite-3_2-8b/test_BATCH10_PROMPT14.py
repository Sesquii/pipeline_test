This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for both `hash_file` and `scramble_files` functions. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code.
