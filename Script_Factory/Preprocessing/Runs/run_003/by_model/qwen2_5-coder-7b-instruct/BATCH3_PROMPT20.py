This Python script implements a basic "Reverse Debugger". It defines a simple function `simple_function()` that prints some values and returns the sum. The `main()` function uses Python's built-in `sys.settrace()` to trace all line events in the execution of `simple_function`. The traced events are stored in a list, which is then printed in reverse chronological order. This makes it harder to follow the logical flow of the program.
