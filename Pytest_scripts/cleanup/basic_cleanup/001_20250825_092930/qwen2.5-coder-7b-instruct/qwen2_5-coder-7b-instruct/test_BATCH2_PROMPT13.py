This script defines a function `expand_acronym` that takes an acronym and a depth as input. It recursively expands the acronym according to a predefined dictionary of known acronyms until the specified depth is reached. The main entry point demonstrates how to use this function with an example acronym "NASA" and a recursion depth of 3.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `expand_acronym` function, covering both positive and negative scenarios. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code.
