Here's a complete Python script named `distracted_image_labeler.py` that meets your requirements:

```python
import cv2
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
import random

# Define a function to draw bounding boxes and labels on an image
def draw_bounding_boxes(image_path, detections):
    # Load the image using OpenCV
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    
    # Convert the image from BGR to RGB for PIL operations
    img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    
    # Create an ImageDraw object for drawing on the image
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(Image.fromarray(img_rgb))
    
    # Define colors for correct and incorrect labels
    correct_color = (0, 255, 0)  # Green
    incorrect_color = (255, 0, 0)  # Red
    
    # Define the font for text
    font = ImageFont.load_default()
    
    # Process each detection
    for (top_left, bottom_right, label) in detections:
        # Randomly decide if to keep or change the label
        if random.random() < 0.6:
            color = correct_color
            text = f"{label}"
        else:
            incorrect_labels = ["car", "tree", "person", "bicycle"]
            incorrect_label = random.choice(incorrect_labels)
            color = incorrect_color
            text = f"{incorrect_label} (wrong)"
        
        # Draw the bounding box and label on the image
        draw.rectangle([top_left, bottom_right], outline=color, width=2)
        draw.text((top_left[0], top_left[1] - 10), text, font=font, fill=color)
    
    # Save the annotated image as output.png in the current directory
    output_path = "output.png"
    img_rgb.save(output_path)

# Main function to execute the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set the seed for random number generation for reproducibility
    random.seed(42)
    
    # Example detections with correct labels
    detections = [
        ((50, 80), (200, 250), "cat"),
        ((300, 120), (450, 280), "dog")
    ]
    
    # Specify the path to the image
    image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"  # Replace with the actual image path
    
    # Draw bounding boxes and labels on the image
    draw_bounding_boxes(image_path, detections)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Imports**:
   - The script imports necessary libraries: `cv2` for image processing, `PIL.Image`, `ImageDraw`, and `ImageFont` for drawing text, and `random` for random operations.

2. **Function to Draw Bounding Boxes and Labels**:
   - `draw_bounding_boxes(image_path, detections)` is the main function that processes each detection.
   - It loads the image using OpenCV and converts it to RGB for PIL operations.
   - It iterates over each detection, randomly deciding whether to keep or change the label.
   - It uses distinct colors (green for correct labels and red for incorrect labels) and draws bounding boxes with labels on the image.

3. **Main Execution**:
   - The script sets a random seed to ensure reproducibility.
   - It defines an example list of detections with their true labels.
   - It specifies the path to the image.
   - It calls `draw_bounding_boxes` to process and save the annotated image as `output.png`.

### Assumptions:
- The input image is in JPEG format (change the file extension if your image is in another format).
- The bounding box coordinates are specified as tuples `(top_left, bottom_right)`, where `top_left` and `bottom_right` are tuples of `(x, y)` coordinates.

This script should run without external dependencies beyond those specified. You can easily modify the detection list or label pool if desired by changing the values in the `detections` list and the `incorrect_labels` list respectively.
