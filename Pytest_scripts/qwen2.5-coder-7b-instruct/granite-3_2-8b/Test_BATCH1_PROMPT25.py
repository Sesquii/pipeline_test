This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for all public functions and classes in the `MemoryLossStoryteller` class. It covers both positive and negative test cases, uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code.
