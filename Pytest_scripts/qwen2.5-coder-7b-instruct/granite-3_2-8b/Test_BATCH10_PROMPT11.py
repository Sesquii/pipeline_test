This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `draw_shape` function. It covers both positive and negative scenarios, including default parameters, custom characters, maximum depth, negative size, zero size, and large size. The use of `pytest.raises(SystemExit)` ensures that the function exits as expected when invalid input is provided.
