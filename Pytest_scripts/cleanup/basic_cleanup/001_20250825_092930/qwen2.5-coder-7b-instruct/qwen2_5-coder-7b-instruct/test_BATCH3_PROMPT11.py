This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `sort_by_circle_of_fifths` function. It covers positive scenarios with a list of musical chords, an empty list, and invalid chords that raise a KeyError. Additionally, it tests the creation of the `chord_map` dictionary to ensure it correctly maps each chord to its index in the circle of fifths. The test cases are organized using pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, and type hints are added to the test functions for clarity.
