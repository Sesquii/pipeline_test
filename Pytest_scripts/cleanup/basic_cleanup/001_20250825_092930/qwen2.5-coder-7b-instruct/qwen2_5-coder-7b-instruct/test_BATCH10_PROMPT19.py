This Python program defines a simple "Self-Correcting Spelling Bot" that attempts to replace common words with less common but still valid alternatives. The bot uses a predefined dictionary for word corrections and applies it to a list of test words. The output displays both the original and corrected words.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for both the `correct_word` function and the `main` function. It uses positive and negative test cases to ensure that the bot correctly replaces common words with their alternatives and handles unknown words appropriately. The `test_main` function captures the output of the `main` function to verify that it produces the expected text.
