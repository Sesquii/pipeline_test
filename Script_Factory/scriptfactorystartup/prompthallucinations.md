3. Entropy Ranking of the 25 Prompts
Here’s my take — using your definitions:

Capacity → How much chaos/errors the prompt can generate in code.

Entropic Allure → How “NLP-chaotic” the idea sounds in human language.

Orientation → Does converting to code increase or decrease chaos? (+ or – sign)

Baseline → Weighted composite (Capacity 50%, Allure 30%, Orientation 20%).

9	Infinite Compliment Engine	6	9	–	6.6
10	Self-Sabotaging Chess Bot	10	9	+	9.4
11	AI Mood Ring	5	8	–	6.0

25 Hallucinated Script-Prompt Ideas
(Each phrased as a high-level prompt that can be adjusted before running in LLMs.)

Chaotic Recipe Generator — Make a program that creates absurd cooking recipes mixing cuisines incorrectly (e.g., sushi lasagna).

Useless Calendar App — Builds a calendar but randomly swaps months and weekdays.

Emotion-Driven File Sorter — Sort files by “how happy they make the AI feel” using arbitrary rules.

Reverse Summarizer — Takes a short sentence and expands it into an unnecessarily long essay.

Bug-Obfuscator — Reads a Python file and injects harmless but confusing variable names.

Randomized Password Crippler — Strengthens a password, then deliberately weakens it.

Unstable Weather Forecaster — Predicts tomorrow’s weather using only the current playlist on Spotify.

Pointless Blockchain Logger — Logs local CPU usage to a fake blockchain system.

Infinite Compliment Engine — Continuously generates random praise but occasionally insults the user by accident.

Self-Sabotaging Chess Bot — Plays chess against itself but tries to lose on purpose in creative ways.

AI Mood Ring — Changes CLI background color based on random “AI mood swings.”

Intermittent To-Do List — Deletes one random to-do item every hour.

Unhelpful Code Commenter — Adds vague comments like “good stuff here” or “fix maybe” in random places.

Delayed Response Chatbot — Intentionally waits a random number of minutes before replying.

Distracted Image Labeler — Labels only 60% of objects in an image and guesses the rest incorrectly.

Recursive Excuse Generator — Generates excuses for why the last excuse failed.

Arbitrary Alarm Clock — Rings only when a stock price hits a random target.

Non-Deterministic Unit Converter — Converts units but changes the conversion ratio every run.

Glitchy ASCII Artist — Converts images to ASCII but randomly corrupts 10% of characters.

Fictional News Generator — Writes news headlines mixing real and fake events unpredictably.

Selective Data Destroyer — Deletes half of a dataset according to “AI intuition.”

Inefficient Sort Algorithm — Implements sorting in the most computationally wasteful way possible.

Tone-Shifting Email Rewriter — Rewrites emails changing tone mid-sentence.

Mood-Based Random Number Generator — RNG seeded by simulated “emotional state.”

Memory-Loss Storyteller — Writes a story but forgets earlier plot points halfway through.
