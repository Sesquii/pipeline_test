This solution follows all the requirements specified in the question. It includes comprehensive test cases that cover both positive and negative scenarios, uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, and adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines.
