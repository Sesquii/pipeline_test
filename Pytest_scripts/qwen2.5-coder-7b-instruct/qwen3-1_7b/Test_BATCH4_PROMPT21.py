# Add more test cases as needed

This solution includes comprehensive test cases for the `main` function. It tests both positive and negative scenarios, including handling of invalid input and no input. The test cases use pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, add type hints to test functions, include proper docstrings and comments, and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
