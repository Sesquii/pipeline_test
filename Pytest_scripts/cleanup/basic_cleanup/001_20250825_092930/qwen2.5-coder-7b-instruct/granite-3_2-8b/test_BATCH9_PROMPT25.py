Note: The provided script contains an infinite loop, which is generally undesirable in real applications. However, for testing purposes, we simulate a finite number of iterations to check if the function behaves as expected when interrupted. The second test case uses pytest's timeout feature to ensure that the function does not run indefinitely, which serves as a conceptual test for handling such scenarios.
