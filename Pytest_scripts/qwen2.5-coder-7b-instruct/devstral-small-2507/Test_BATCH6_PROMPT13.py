This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for all public functions and classes in the original script. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and separates the original code from the test code clearly.
