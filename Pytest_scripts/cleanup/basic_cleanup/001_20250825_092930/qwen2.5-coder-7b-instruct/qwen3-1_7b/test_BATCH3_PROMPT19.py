This test suite includes comprehensive tests for the `main` function, covering positive and negative scenarios. It uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code.
