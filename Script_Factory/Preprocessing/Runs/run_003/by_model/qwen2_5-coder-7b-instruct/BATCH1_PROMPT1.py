This Python script defines a set of cuisines and their typical ingredients. It then randomly pairs two different cuisines, selects one ingredient from each, and combines them into an absurd recipe. The program generates a whimsical recipe name, humorous step-by-step instructions that mix cooking techniques or cultural references from both cuisines, and outputs at least five such recipes in JSON format to stdout.
