This Python script, named `BATCH6_PROMPT18_{{model_name}}.py`, takes a string of English text as input and encodes it into a binary representation where each character's ASCII value is written in an 8-bit block, and then every third bit is randomly flipped. The script uses Python's standard library and includes a clear entry point for running the program directly from the command line.
