This code defines a `ReverseSummarizer` class with an `expand` method that takes a short sentence and expands it into an unnecessarily long essay. The essay contains at least five times as many words as the input sentence, and each sentence is limited to no more than 25 words for readability. The expansion uses random templates to keep the output varied.
