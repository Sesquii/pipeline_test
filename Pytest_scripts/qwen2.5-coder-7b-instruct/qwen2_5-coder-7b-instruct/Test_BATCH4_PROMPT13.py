This Python program reads a text file, counts the occurrences of each word, and exaggerates the count for common words like "the", "a", and "an" by multiplying their counts by 100. The results are printed to the console as a dictionary.

This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `exaggerate_word_count` function. It covers normal text files, empty text files, text files with common words, and text files with mixed case and punctuation. The test suite uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and separates the original code from the test code clearly.
