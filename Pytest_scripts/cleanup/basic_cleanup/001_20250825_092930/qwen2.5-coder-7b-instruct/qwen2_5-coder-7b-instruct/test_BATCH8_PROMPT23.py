This script calculates a fixed travel time of 8 hours between two cities, ignoring any actual timezone differences. It serves as a simple demonstration of how timezone ignorance can lead to incorrect results in a "Timezone-Ignoring Time Calculator."

This test suite includes:
- A fixture `city_pair` to provide different city pairs for testing.
- A test case `test_calculate_travel_time` to ensure the function returns a timedelta object and always calculates 8 hours of travel time.
- Negative test cases `test_calculate_travel_time_with_invalid_city` and `test_calculate_travel_time_with_empty_string` to check how the function handles invalid inputs.
