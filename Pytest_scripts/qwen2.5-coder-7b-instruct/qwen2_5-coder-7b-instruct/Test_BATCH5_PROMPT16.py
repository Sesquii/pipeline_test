This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for the `convert_and_comment` function. It covers both positive and negative scenarios, uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and clearly separates the original code from the test code.
