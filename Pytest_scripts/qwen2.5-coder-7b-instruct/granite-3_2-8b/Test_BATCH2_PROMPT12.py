This test suite includes comprehensive tests for the `non_euclidean_distance` function. It uses pytest fixtures to provide valid and invalid points, ensuring that both positive and negative scenarios are covered. The tests check that the function returns a complex number when given valid inputs and raises a `TypeError` when given invalid inputs.
