This Python script defines a `ChattyCLI` class that inherits from `cmd.Cmd`, creating a simple command-line interface. Each command method (e.g., `do_list`, `do_create`) includes an overly verbose confirmation message to meet the requirement. The `cmdloop()` method is called in the entry point to start the interactive loop of the CLI.
