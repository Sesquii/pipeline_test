This script defines a function `fibonacci_with_random_delay` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number while introducing a random delay that increases with the size of the number. The delays are between 0.1 * i and 1.0 * i seconds, where i is the current number in the sequence. The main block prompts the user to enter the position of the Fibonacci number they want to calculate and then prints the result.
