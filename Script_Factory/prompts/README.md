# Prompts Folder

## Purpose
Houses all script-generation prompts, both for initial code creation and follow-up optimization tasks.  
This is the seed content for the Script Factory workflow.

## Contents
- Prompt templates with placeholders for variables like model name, entropy mode, or bit precision.
- A master prompt list (numbered for easy reference) to maintain consistent experiment scope.
- Variations of the same prompt used for different testing sequences.

## To-Do
- Draft and store 25 "hallucinated" script prompts for baseline runs.
- Keep prompt versions organized â€” one change at a time to maintain clean test data.
- Include notes on expected entropy level for each prompt (for later entropy analysis).
