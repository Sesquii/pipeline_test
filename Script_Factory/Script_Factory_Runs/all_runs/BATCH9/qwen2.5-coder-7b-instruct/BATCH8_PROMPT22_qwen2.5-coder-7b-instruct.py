### Logical Paradox Explanation:
In the provided script, there is no logical paradox introduced because the time zone consideration is explicitly removed in the final calculation. However, if one were to introduce a logical paradox intentionally, it could be done by assuming that the original `datetime` objects are already adjusted for different time zones and then proceeding as if they are naive (i.e., unaware of time zones). This would lead to incorrect results because the initial assumption about the time zones being considered is contradicted when they are not.
