```

This test suite includes comprehensive tests for the `insert_comment` and `process_file` functions. It covers both positive and negative scenarios, including edge cases like empty input files and non-existent input files. The use of pytest fixtures and parametrization is not explicitly shown in this example, but it can be applied where appropriate to further enhance test coverage and readability.
