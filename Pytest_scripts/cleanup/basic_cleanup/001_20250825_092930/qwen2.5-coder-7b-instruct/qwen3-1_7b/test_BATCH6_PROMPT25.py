This test suite includes comprehensive test cases for all public functions and classes in the original script. It tests both positive and negative scenarios, uses pytest fixtures and parametrization where appropriate, adds type hints to test functions, includes proper docstrings and comments, follows PEP 8 style guidelines, and adds a clear separator between the original code and test code.
